# Object Oriented JavaScript

## Outline

* Why am I writing about Object Oriented JavaScript?
* Why have I switched from functional programming to Object Oriented?
  * Does it have to be one or the other?
* What is Object Oriented Programming?
  * Encapsulation
  * Inheritance, composition, delegation
  * Polymorphism
* Is Object Oriented programming in JavaScript different than other programming languages?
  * Classical vs Prototypal inheritance
  * What does it mean in practice?
* Guiding Principles of Object Oriented Programming
  * SOLID
    * Single-Responsibility Principle
    * Open-Closed Principle
    * Liskov-Substitution Principle
    * Interface-Segregation Principle
    * Dependency-Inversion Principle
  * Package Principles
    * Reuse-release Equivalence Principle
    * Common-Reuse Principle
    * Common-Closure Principle
    * Acyclic Dependencies Principle
    * Stable-Dependencies Principle
    * Stable-Abstractions Principle
  * Refactoring
    * Strategies
    * Test-Driven Development
* Case Studies
  * Why case studies?
  * How to read the case studies
  * The actual case studies
    * Case Study 1: Todo App
      * Defining the idea
      * Initial strategy for implementation
      * Write the initial code with TDD
      * New features!
      * Refactor
      * Implement the new features
      * Review
    * Case Study 2: Bed and Breakfast App
      * Defining the idea
      * Defining the actors
      * Splitting it all up (agile-sprint style)
      * Stategy for first round of features
      * Implement with TDD
      * Strategy for second round of features
      * Refactor
      * Implement with TDD
      * Review
    * Case Study 3: MMORPG Game
      * Defining the game & rules
      * Choosing a scenario to implement first
      * Designing the game engine
      * Implementing the game engine with TDD while implementing the first scenario
      * Review
* Design Patterns
  * Will likely put these in the case studies if they are used
  * When to use a design pattern
  * When _not_ to use a design pattern
